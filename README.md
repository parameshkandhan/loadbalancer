This project revolves around the implementation of Load Balancing with Elastic Load Balancer, employed to effectively regulate network traffic within a designated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). In scenarios of heightened traffic, the system will dynamically spawn new instances through an auto-scaling mechanism, ensuring responsive and scalable infrastructure to accommodate varying workloads seamlessly. This strategic utilization of Elastic Load Balancer, coupled with auto-scaling capabilities, enhances the system's capacity to gracefully handle increased demand, thereby optimizing overall performance and resource allocation.
VPC: Sub netting allows organizations to divide their IP address space into smaller, more manageable segments. This is especially important in situations where there might be a limited pool of IP addresses available.
Sub netting enables organizations to allocate IP addresses based on their specific needs for different departments, locations, or network segments.
Sub netting can be used to isolate different parts of a network. This isolation can enhance security by controlling the flow of traffic between subnets and making it more challenging for unauthorized access or attacks to spread across the network.
Network administrators can implement different security policies and access controls for each subnet, providing granular control over network resources.
Load balancer: A load balancer is a critical component in computer networking and web hosting that distributes incoming network traffic or application requests across multiple servers. The primary purpose of a load balancer is to ensure that no single server bears too much load, preventing potential performance bottlenecks and improving the overall reliability and availability of the application or website.
Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers based on various algorithms, such as Round Robin, Least Connections, or Weighted Round Robin. This helps evenly distribute the load and prevent overloading of any single server.
In case the network traffic use a  Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your infrastructure dynamically based on predefined policies or schedules.
Auto scaling: The core component of Auto Scaling is the Auto Scaling Group. An Auto Scaling Group is a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are created from a common Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and are designed to work together. The group automatically adjusts the number of instances in response to changes in demand.
Scaling policies define when and how the Auto Scaling Group should adjust its capacity. There are two main types of scaling policies:
scale Out (Add Capacity): Triggered when a specified metric exceeds a certain threshold, leading to the addition of new instances.
Scale In (Remove Capacity): Triggered when a specified metric falls below a certain threshold, resulting in the termination of instances.
Cloudwatch: For the monitoring purpose need to use the  Amazon Cloud Watch and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) are integral services in AWS that provide monitoring and notification capabilities, respectively. Combining these services can enable you to create professional and effective alerting and notification systems. Here's a guide on how to use CloudWatch and SNS in a professional way.
Set up CloudWatch Alarms based on your custom metrics or predefined metrics for AWS resources. Alarms allow you to trigger actions when certain thresholds are breached.
Integrate CloudWatch Logs to capture and analyze log data. Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for advanced querying and analysis of log data.
To create a cloud watch need to be add the Organize  subscribers using SNS Topics. Topics act as communication channels for sending messages to multiple endpoints.
Subscribe your endpoints (email addresses, SMS numbers, HTTP endpoints, etc.) to relevant SNS Topics. This allows them to receive notifications.
